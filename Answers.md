1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

It is a JS Library used for responsive UI and creating UI components.

React JS allows us to write in html, css and js all within the same document. It is also broadly which allow for others to be better equipped for it. I also read that it is an easier Library to use, it may be true IDK, it sure doesn't feel like it.  

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

Thinking in react is learning how to break everything down into its on little box or component. From there it allows you to move things around in the form of a tree.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class/Stateful component holds the state and is normally located at the base of your work so as to be passed to the rest of the branches. 
Functional/presentational components are functions and not classes and they are what pass the State around using props. 

1.  Describe state.

State holds information that influences the output and is managed within the components similar to a variable declared within a function

1.  Describe props.

Just like state props hold information that influences the output. However, props are for passing around information more like a parameter. Often times holding state information and allowing it to be moved from one place to another. Just as if you would redefine something.
